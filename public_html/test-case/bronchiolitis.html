Dear group,
I got permission from the family to post this case, urgently needing any possible valuable advise.
below is a brief summary
Greek Female DOB: 6th Oct 2004 (8.5 years old)
PMH
Severe Neonatal jaundice ? exchange transfusion
Hemoglobin H Disease (deletion of 3 of the four a-globin genes, associated with a-thalassemia indermedia-like syndrome). No transfusins
Decreased Bone density
History of frequent respiratory infections, History of asthma
Allogeneic Bone Marrow transplatation July 3 2012
Donor: Her sister (DOB 9th May 2005), compatible 10/10, CMV and EBV negative.
Very good engraftment with uncomplicated recovery, discharged home 20 days post transplant on Cyclosporine 30mg bid, Ursofalk, Zovirax, Ciproxin, Fungostatin, Zinadol. Ciproxin and Fungostatin were discontinued and was placed on Pentamidine and Co-trimoxasole
Had mild dermatitis in August and September in the intertriginous areas and some hyperpigmented spots over her trunk without other signs or symptoms indicative of GVHD. Hyperpigmentation resolved by November 12.
She was very active, playing and dancing and walking up and down stairs at their home without any difficulty or signs on dyspnea on exertion. Her aunt who is a young doctor and lived with her for most of the time post transplant was watching her very closely
January 9, 2013 had Hb 14gr/dl WBC 3750 PMNs 46% Lympho39% Monos 11% Plts 256k.
On January 20, 2013 her sister developed a runny nose and cough and on January 24 our patient started with dry cough. Her pediatrician examined her the next day and found crackles in both lung bases, She put her on Albuterol and Fluticasone inhalations and oral cefuroxime. On January 29th on follow up she had not improved and for the first time she had difficulty walking up the stairs. After communication with the Transplant Center, Cefuroxime was stopped and she was placed on 2 mg Dexamethasone/day (for 3 days only) and Clarithromycin. Was seen again after 3 days. Cough had stopped but she had not improved clinically.
Was brought to Transplant center February 5th had a normal CXR and wheezing with prolonged expiration on exam. Treatment was modified to Azithromycin, Albuterol, Ipratropium and Budesonide nebs. She returns to her home town but she gets worse with dyspnea on exertion and returns to Transplant Center for follow up. Her aunt-doctor describes her with severe dyspnea on exertion, impressive retractions and tachypnea. Pedi pulmonary exam was done on Febr 18, with O2 Sat 98% decreased air entry, no abnormal breath sounds, hyperinflated chest. HRCT shows bilateral air trapping and mosaic pattern in the RML and lingula. Spirometry on Febr 19 shows FVC 24% Pre, FEV1 23% Pre, FVC/FEV1 90% Pre, FEF 25-75: 17% Pre.
Diagnosis of Bronchiolitis Oblitterans is made and is started on Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and Budesonide is increased to 0.5 mg bid.
Follow up Spirometry one month later showed FVC 34% Pre, FEV1 24% Pre, ?FEF 25-75 13% Pre. O 2 Sat 95%.
Attempted to do lung volumes but could not cooperate. She continued with Methylprednisolone and pulse steroids were recommended by the pediatric Pulmonologist. A second pedi pulmonology evaluation was asked at another hospital. Further investigations were done with oximetry with mild exercise showing desat to 93%, overnight oximetry showing desats to 89% , repeat Spirometry essentially unchanged, repeat HRCT showing mosaic pattern, air trapping and some bronchiectasies, bronchscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy.
She underwent bronchoscopy that showed edema and hyperemia of the LUL mucosa and mucous secretions non both sides, with BAL and 3 samples of transbronchial tissue, on April 24. Biopsy showed intra-alveolar inflammatory exudate with polymorphonuclear predominance, no evidence of BO. BAL showed also 40% PMNs and increased number of lymphocytes (I do not have at hand the exact number). Stains and cultures wee negative for bacteria fungi and AFB. Biopsy material was tested for viruses and was found PCR positive for RSV. ?
Unfortunately she developed tension pneumothorax during the transbronchial biopsy and since then she is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator.
She is currently on 35% FiO2 with PIP pressures up to 27.
Her treatment includes Cyclosporine Azithromycin, Acyclovir, Fluconazlole, Tazobactam, Teicoplanin, Ribavirin via NG and has received one dose of Synagis IV.
I was asked to contribute only 2 days ago. A meting was held yesterday with all her doctors involved and was decided to start her on Methylprednislolone pulses at 30 mg/kg day for 3 days.
I am afraid that she is not responding and my questions to the group are.
1. Based on her history and absence of at least obvious GVHD is this acutely evolving and rapidly deteriorating BO postinfectious?
If so what is the possible role of RSV? (I can recall of only one case report of BO secondary to RSV)

2. I am thinking of repeating the pulse after 3 to 7 days but any experience with first choice of other anti-inflammatory medications?
(In the literature various meds have been suggested such as azathioprime, methotrextae, mofetil, and even infiximab).
